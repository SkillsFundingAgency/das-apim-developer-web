        <p>Integrating with our API may be useful if you are a large employer and want to create adverts using your existing systems. It will allow you to publish to multiple sites, as well as <a href="#" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">Find an apprenticeship</a>. </p>
        <p>You can also use the API to display all your adverts on any website.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does the API do?</h2>
        <p>APIs let applications share information and data with each other.</p>
        <p>If you connect using our API, you can use your own systems to create adverts on <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Find an apprenticeship</a>.</p>
        <p>You can also use our API to display your adverts on any website.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the API?</h2>
        <p>You can share this <a href="#" class="govuk-link">technical documentation</a> with the person who is going to connect your software program with the API. </p>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your software program with the API, for example a software developer.</div>
        <p>It can take a while to connect using an API, so leave enough time to integrate it.</p>
        <p>Only accounts with owner permissions can access the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">API hub</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I access the API?</h2>
        <p>If you have owner permissions you can access the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">API hub</a>.</p>
        <p>Your developer will be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where can I get help and support?</h2>
        <p>If you have any issues, either during development or once your software is live, you can get <a href="#" class="govuk-link">help and support</a> from us.</p>
