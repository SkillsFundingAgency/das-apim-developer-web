            <p>Integrating with our <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Recruitment API</a> may be useful if you are a large employer and want to create adverts using your existing systems. It will allow you to publish to multiple sites, as well as <a href="@linksConfig?.Value?.FindAnApprenticeshipSiteUrl" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">Find an apprenticeship</a>. </p>
            <p>You can also use the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Display adverts API</a> to display all your adverts on any website.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does the API do?</h2>
            <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other.</p>
            <p>If you connect using our <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Recruitment API</a>, you can use your own systems to create adverts on <a href="@linksConfig?.Value?.FindAnApprenticeshipSiteUrl" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">Find an apprenticeship</a>.</p>
            <p>You can also use our <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Display adverts API</a> to display your adverts on any website.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the API?</h2>
            <div class="govuk-inset-text">You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your software program with the API, for example a software developer.</div>
            <p>You can share this <a href="#" class="govuk-link">API page</a> with the person who is going to connect your software program with the API. </p>
            <p>It can take a while to connect using an API, so leave enough time to integrate it.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I access the API?</h2>
            <p>If you have owner permissions you can access the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">API keys</a>.</p>
            <p>Your developer will be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.</p>
            <p>You will need to <a href="#" class="govuk-link">provide your developer with a key</a> so they can use the API.</p>
