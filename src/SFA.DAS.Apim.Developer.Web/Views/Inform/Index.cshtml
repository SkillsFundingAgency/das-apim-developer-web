        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does the API do?</h2>
        <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other. </p>
        <p>If you connect using the Recruitment API, you can use your own systems to publish to <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Find an apprenticeship</a>.</p>
        <p>You can also use the Display adverts API to retrieve adverts from Find an Apprenticeship and display on your websites.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I use the API?</h2>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">You'll need someone with technical knowledge to connect your system with the API, for example a software developer.</div>
        <p>You can share the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">developer get started page</a> with the person who is going to connect your system with the API, they can access the API from there. </p>
        <p>It can take a while to connect using an API, so leave enough time to integrate it.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How do I access the API?</h2>
        <p>If you have owner permissions you can access the <a asp-route="@RouteNames.EmployerApiHub" asp-route-employerAccountId="@Model" class="govuk-link">API keys</a>.</p>
        <p>Your developer will be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.</p>
        <p>You will need to <a href="#" class="govuk-link">provide your developer with a key</a> and <a href="#" class="govuk-link">the developer get started page</a> so they can use the APIs.</p>    
    </div>
